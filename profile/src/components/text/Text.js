        That being said I am a avid bicyclist and although I havent worked out recently I do like 
        excercise (see my hobbies section). I am an army reservist having been a war history buff for 
        many years (and wanting to have some excuse for a good workout). To be continued :)`}</p>

				Since I am writing this in the winter, I am less enthusiastic about
				cycling currently mainly because the weather does not agree. That being
				said once the weather gets better I am sure I will be cycling once
				again. I have been a bicyclist all my life, I am used to biking long
				distances as I will explain below. Bicycling can be used as a
				combination of excercise, meditation, sight seeing, and transportation
				and I rate my experience in that order. It is a good excuse to go
				outside especially if you have one of those days where you arent doing
				anything. Overall you get to explore the city on your own terms be on
				the road, sidewalk, alleyway or even through a nice trail.

				I have biked to Niagra Falls from Toronto on multiple occasions (5
				times). The first time around was the most taxing but it was just a
				matter of willpower moreso than any physical endurance (though it did
				require some). The trail I took was the Lakes Waterfront Trail as it ran
				through the city of Toronto all the way to the falls. Biking through
				Oakville and other communties like Burlington was a treat but the best
				part is definitely cycling through the country side where it was filled
				with open fields as far as the eye can see. Lots of good fruits too from
				the farmers out there. It almost became a ritual, as there was back to
				back trips every subsequent summer from I believe 2014. Theres a map on
				the side to show you the route taken.

				So biking to Georgian Bay was a tale of tedium and tenacity. The overall
				trip was not entirely pleasant it was filled with episodes of extreme
				fatigue and biking through extreme heat in the day to extreme cold in
				the pitch darkness. The route we took is shown on the left but suffice
				to say it was a grueling journey with many days of unremarkable progress
				through mostly flat terrain and small towns though at times we did stop
				by many provincial parks where we busted out our hammock tents to sleep
				I can speak volumes on the entire trip if you would like to know more I
				will be making a seperate article/webpage talking more about this.
